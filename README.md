## Till Now what we have done

> First tried to train the model on [this](https://www.kaggle.com/tejasreddy/iam-handwriting-top50) dataset. Code for this can be found [here](https://github.com/dawaaiiML/DawaaiiResources/blob/main/Building_NN_with_IAM_Words.ipynb). Got a descent accuracy of 70% but the dataset was not having varieties of handwrittent text and will not able to predict properly if given a complex handwritten image.

> In the second step we tried another dataset. The code link can be found [here](https://github.com/dawaaiiML/DawaaiiResources/blob/main/iam-dataset-preview.ipynb) and dataset link [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ashish2001/iam-dataset-modified). In this dataset, we have varieties of handwritten text which we found as a descent data for training the model, but the problem was lack of RAM, and we were not able to create the model properly.

> So In the next step, we tried training our model on azure Virtual Machine on CPU, but the time taken by the CPU was way much than GPU. So we dropped this approach. You can found the approach of this code [here](https://github.com/dawaaiiML/DawaaiiResources/blob/main/v1.html)

> Now we are trying to build our model on [Colab Pro](https://colab.research.google.com/signup) which is the cheapest GPU option left on the same dataset.
